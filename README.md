# Configuration program for linux system

This will be a simple program that will allow me to setup a clear linux install with all the stuff I usually need to install manually.

This would include `git`, `fish` shell, `powerline fonts`, `tilix`, `vim` with plugins, themes for everything, gui programs that can be easily fetched and installed by terminal etc.

The idea is to have a simple script - probably bash - that will do the wget or curl, launch the install script if needed, configure stuff in the system etc all by itself, allowing a _one command rule them all_ to ease up the system installation.

## TODO

* [ ] Complete the first stub of the readme!
* [ ] List all the stuff needed (and why)
* [ ] Find all install instructions
* [ ] Define dependencies
* [ ] Logically decide the steps
* [ ] bash script or python?
